	        <h3>We will briefly explain our project! </h3>

          <h4> Problem: </h4>
	        <p>The problem is that not everyone has the habit of reading, and there are some countries that ban books so 
nobody can read them probably because the ideas or information in the book is not accepted by the government.
We want to give easy and cheap access to books (we want to include many payment methods).</p>
          <h4> Audience: </h4>
	        <p>Our audience is people looking to expand their knowledge, we want people commited on reading books and that want
to read every kind of books with different ideas or controversial data that makes difficult its distribution.
We want easy access to books from all over the world, because sometimes it happens that you are looking for a book and
it can't be found in your country. We even want kids to be involved and schools to support us, by making their students
read some of the books that might be difficult to get but are good books. </p>
          <h4> Solution and impact: </h4>
          <p>Our plan is to sell every type of books or give them under license so you can rent books for a period of time.
We want people to access books easily and in an type, physical books that we can send them to 
their adress or electronic books. What distinguishes us from our competitors is that we will be discrete to 
our costumers on the type of books they read or what they read, we want to distribute every book because we 
think that censorship is a wrong thing to do to books. So if a country bans an specific book, we Bookin' won't
provide information to governments if people from that country want to read that book. Our objective is to 
distribute knowledge and ideas and we want to achieve a world where ideas can't be banned.

We plan to make a global impact because we will give easy and cheap access all over the world an since we won't
ban any book from our store, some governments might want to censor some of the books in our database and we won't allow
it because it goes against freedom. </p>
